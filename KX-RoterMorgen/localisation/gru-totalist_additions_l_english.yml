rotermorgenmisc.30.t:0 "All to the Chairman"
rotermorgenmisc.30.d:0 "Finally, he had done it. Weeks if not months of scheming, maneuvering, and backstabbing have all led up to this point. And now, Pieck stands at the mountaintop as the undisputed master of Germany’s revolution with his proclamation as the Supreme Chairman of Germany and the Revolution. Of course, his detractors will scream and cry over how he’s a revisionist demagogue who betrayed the revolution, but the opinions of those at the bottom mean little to Pieck. Even now as his supporters organize impromptu celebrations over his proclamation, much work still needs to be done to secure tomorrow for Germany and the revolution. But now that arduous task will be all the more easier now that fickle things such as “democracy” don’t stand in the way."

rotermorgenmisc.31.t:0 "The Dark Red Constitution Part I"
rotermorgenmisc.31.d:0 "The constitution starts out with the preamble, pledging that the document will defend the working class, equality, and the revolution along with its protection. After the preamble comes the basic rights that are to be granted to the citizenry. It guarantees each citizen equal protections under the law no matter what sex, race, or creed. On top of this, it lays out the provisions in which people are allowed to own property. There are certain caps to the amount of wealth and property one can own, and violations of such caps will be considered bourgeois and will be dealt with accordingly. Eventually, the system of private property will be phased out and be replaced with total public ownership once the revolution has progressed to the according stages. Next it discusses the workplace, guaranteeing that unions are to be nationalized and reorganized into more effective governing bodies run by the state to ensure streamlined and productive workplaces. Below this it discusses militias and the military within Germany, which states that all members must swear an oath of loyalty to the revolution, the worker, and the Supreme Chairman. Militias are to be reorganized by the state apparatus into the Red Guards, with any remaining militias to be disbanded, along with a clause stating that the Red Guards are to be Germany’s “Vanguard of the Revolution”, effectively banning any independent militias from forming. Then comes the matter of religion, which establishes Germany as a secular state and for organized religion to be reactionary in nature."

rotermorgenmisc.32.t:0 "The Dark Red Convention Part II"
rotermorgenmisc.32.d:0 "After the first part comes the structure of government. First is the creation of the executive post, whose official title is the Supreme Chairman of Germany and the Party. The Supreme Chairman is to be the highest authority within Germany, with a Deputy Chairman acting as his second in command. The Supreme Chairman will be able to select a cabinet of officials to head to various departments and agencies within Germany while also acting as a theoretical power sharing body with the Supreme Chairman, this organization will be known as the Politburo. Next comes the creation of a new legislative unicameral body named the People’s Chamber, or Volkskammer.  The Volkskammer will consist of democratically elected officials from the various designated administrative regions of Germany to represent their working constituents. While on paper the legislative body represents Germans as a whole and shares power with the Supreme Chairman and the Politburo, it is effectively a rubber-stamping body with no real power. The head of the Volkskammer is the Chamber President, who is elected by a legislative vote every 5 years. The deputy president of the chamber will serve as the president ‘s second in command, with the senior most MLPD legislator serving as the designated successor of the deputy president. Bellow that comes the nature of parties. Only the MLPD is allowed to hold any positions in the government. The SPD, FAUD, the SEPD , and the NMDVP are not allowed to run for any type of political office, and as their existence acts as a threat to the Revolution and the government they are not allowed to continue operations legally. The clause also effectively bans any future opposition parties from forming, effectively making the Bolshevik faction of the SMEPD the only legally allowed party in Germany. Finally, bellow the parties comes the judicial system, where a series of government appointed people’s courts will settle disputes and crimes committed. Every citizen is entitled to a defense and a jury of peers. These rights will be void should a high crime such as treason be committed."

rotermorgenmisc.33.t:0 "The Finishing Touches"
rotermorgenmisc.33.d:0 "After a full month of laying out the provisions of the constitution, all delegates signed the constitution into practice with Pieck being the first signature. Right away, snap elections for the People’s Chamber were held all across Germany, and state departments were formalized into existence. Opposition parties are now starting to face mass crackdowns all over Germany by the Red Guards, officially crushing all official opposition in Germany. Across the world, communist and totalist organizations and nations have sent congratulatory messages to the new Germany for solidifying their centralized and revolutionary system without major bloodshed. However, some have noted how the constitution seems to have a few loopholes which may be exploited for the benefit of the ruling party. Thalmann and his faction are still furious over the constitution, calling Pieck a reactionary in a revolutionary’s garbs, who is working to secure his own goals and not that of the worker. As for Pieck’s role, many hold little if any doubts that Pieck will remain at the forefront of the new Germany. Whatever the case may be, the workers of Germany and the world are now a step closer to being truly free under a new kind of revolution."

Eventually, the system of private property will be phased out and be replaced with total public ownership once the revolution has progressed to the according stages. Next it discusses the workplace, guaranteeing that unions are directly in control of the workplace where they will implement democracy among the workers. Below this it discusses militias and the military within Germany, which states that all members must swear an oath of loyalty to the revolution, the worker, and democracy. Militias are legally permitted to form and bear arms as long as they are registered with Germany’s defense force, any activity committed by a militia which is found to be unconstitutional or anti-revolutionary will result in an immediate disbandment. Then comes the matter of religion, which establishes Germany as a secular state and for organized religion to be reactionary in nature. "

rotermorgenmisc.35.t:0 "The Bright Red Constitution Part II"
rotermorgenmisc.35.d:0 "After the first part comes the structure of government. First is the creation of the legislative body which will serve as the main governing body. The new unicameral body named the People’s Chamber, or Volkskammer, will consist of democratically elected officials from the various designated administrative regions of Germany to represent their working constitution. While on paper executive power rests within the legislative body as a whole, the de facto head of government will rest with the Chamber President, who is elected by a legislative vote every 5 years. On top of this, the department ministers will serve as the cabinet for the Chamber President who need confirmation by a majority vote of the congress. The deputy president of the chamber will serve as the president ‘s second in command, with the senior most SMEPD legislator serving as the designated successor of the deputy president. Bellow that comes the opposition parties. The SPD, FAUD, the SMEPD (B), and the NMDVP are allowed to continue their political activities and to be represented in parliament only if reorganized appropriately under SMEPD guidelines. They will also be capped in the number of seats they can hold, as all opposition parties cannot hold more than 25% of the chamber seats at a time. Opposition members running for any type of office must also be confirmed by Ministry of the Interior before being able to do so. Finally, bellow the parties comes the judicial system, where a series of democratically elected people’s courts will settle disputes and crimes committed. Every citizen is entitled to a defense and a jury of peers. These rights will be void should a high crime such as treason be committed."

rotermorgenmisc.36.d:0 "After a full month of laying out the provisions of the constitution, all delegates signed the constitution into practice with Thalmann being the first signature. Right away, snap elections for the People’s Chamber were held all across Germany, and state departments were formalized into existence. Opposition parties were formally reorganized and followed the corresponding guidelines to run for office, officially defanging opposition in Germany. Across the world, Syndicalist organizations and nations have sent congratulatory messages to the new Germany for solidifying their democratic and revolutionary system without major bloodshed. However, some have noted how the constitution seems to have a few loopholes which may be exploited for the benefit of the ruling party. Pieck and his faction are still furious over the constitution, calling Thalmann a hypocritical tyrant who is working to secure his own goals and not that of the worker. As for Thalmann’s role, many wonder if he will step up to be the first Chamber President or if he will pass the torch to someone new and take up a smaller role. Whatever the case may be, the workers of Germany are now a step closer to being truly free."
rotermorgenmisc.36.a:0 "To the Working Class and the Revolution!"

rotermorgenmisc.37.t:0 "Volksführerprinzip"
rotermorgenmisc.37.d:0 "Democracy has always been a fool’s game. A rule by a mob of degenerates in turn exploited by Judeo-Capitalists and Judeo-Internationalists who sought to tear nations apart for their own gain. It was what brought the US to it’s current state of instability and Russia to its knees and paved the way for revolutions to take place. Which is why high ranking party members of the NMDVP and it’s aligned militias have urged Goebbels to draft a constitution and create a legislative body. Opposition will not have a voice in this new Germany nor opulent luxury to exist at all, it would only serve to weaken Goebbels and the destiny of Germany. The newly drafted constitution of Germany bans all parties except the NMDVP as well as all civilian organizations not aligned with the Party, the legislative, judicative and executive are no longer separated and ‘Gleichgeschaltet’ while also merging the position of Head of Government with the Head of State into the office of the Volksführer. Germany should only have to heed to the words and decree of its leader. Only the captain at the helm of a ship can only know what’s best for it, not the crewmen beneath him. From now on, the words of the Volksfuhrer are written law."
rotermorgenmisc.37.a:0 "Deutschland Heil! Deutschland Heil! Heil Goebebls!"

rotermorgenmisc.38.t:0 "The Doctors of the Revolution"
rotermorgenmisc.38.d:0 "Everyone knows the importance of doctors. They keep people healthy and functional, ensuring that we remain nice and well for the purpose of serving the people and the revolution. The only issue is that the majority of doctors are bourgeois, living in luxury and many of them coming from privileged backgrounds, and as a result they struggle to emphasize with the common man and the revolution. This cannot continue if we wish for the revolution to advance. Which is why the People’s Chamber has announced the Revolutionary Doctors initiative under the Cultural Revolution. This new program will have specially selected factory workers and peasants be sent to education facilities to be taught the marvels of modern medicine and to raise them to become the new German doctors. As for the former bourgeois doctors, a select few have been chosen to teach the members in the program in exchange for political and societal rehabilitation, while the rest will be sent to either re-education camps or work camps. While some may hold doubts about the quality of these new doctors, with some reports claiming that they gave wrong dosages of medicine to their patients or even dropped surgical tools in their patients during operations, many are optimistic that with more time these doctors will be on par or even better than the old bourgeois ones."

rotermorgenmisc.39.t:0 "The New German Cinema"
rotermorgenmisc.39.d:0 "After the revolution that freed Germany from the Kaiser, the German film industry wasn’t in the best position. Whereas German cinema was largely considered to be on par with Hollywood with both blockbuster and Avant Guard productions, the violent conflict in Germany ground any production to a complete halt. Studios were destroyed, talent either died or fled, and an important medium of German entertainment and culture suffered because of it. However, the NMDVP hopes to change all that through the nationalization and consolidation of UFA. This new nationalization will see UFA gain massive state funding to rebuild the German film industry, while consolidating any remaining non-independent German studios into the company. With its headquarters stationed in Babelsberg outside of Berlin, what the NMDVP hopes to achieve through this is to reforge the wrecked film industry back to the scale of Hollywood, while projecting the new German arts and values on an international level. Even now, UFA has multiple projects in the works which can expect to see releases starting next year. On top of this, UFA is securing agreements with friendly nations to screen their films once released, aspiring actors and actresses come from all over are being encouraged to come to Germany to try to land a part in a production, and directors and state producers constantly negotiate with nations of the world so secure exotic filming locations."

rotermorgenmisc.1040.t:0 "A Germanic Epic"
rotermorgenmisc.1040.d:0 "Since its creation and consolidation, UFA has been able to breathe life into the cinema industry. However, despite its great growth and growing influence in international cinema, it is yet to match that of places like Hollywood. However, the Volksfuhrer has a grand plan to change that, while also potentially creating the greatest German film of all time. Adolf Hitler, the Austrian corporal and war hero who bravely gave his life for the German people and nation and whose public journals were organized into a bestselling book, will be the center of a film series about his fight and triumphs named Sein Kampf. After securing the remaining private journals from his next of kin Geli Raubal, Goebbels and a team of hand-picked script writers will scour over the documents to create a grand script for the series. Already UFA has been able to assemble and ensemble cast for the series, with Hans Albers cast as the brave Hitler, with other major actors and actresses such as Willy Fritsch, Zarah Leander, Heinz Ruhmann, Johannes Heesters, and Marika Rökk in supporting roles. With Goebbels himself at the helm as director, with directors Leni Riefenstahl and Carl Froelich serving as special advisors, and Herbert von Karajan as composer for its score, Sein Kampf is a greatly ambitious project on nearly all levels. However, Goebbels is intending to go another mile to smash expectations by having the whole film done in technicolor. While many hold private doubts about this colossal project, the Volksfuhrer is adamant in his resolve that the series will succeed, and with it will secure Germany’s place as a leader in international cinema."
rotermorgenmisc.1040.a:0 "A Film Series to Stand Above Them All"

rotermorgenmisc.1041.t:0 "A Night at the Theatre"
rotermorgenmisc.1041.d:0 "After a long and grueling production process, the first film in the Sein Kampf series, Gräben der Herrlichkeit or Trenches of Glory, has been released for distribution. On the opening night in Berlin, the ensemble team and the Volksfuhrer were present at the first ever public screening along with a fair amount of the party and military leadership. Most notably, Hitler’s surviving former comrades who served with him in the Weltkreig and in Russia were invited at the personal insistence of Goebbels himself, along with Hitler’s half niece Raubal who provided the remaining private journals for filming. The three hour and fifteen-minute-long epic showcases the life of Hitler in Austria before moving to Bavaria to enlist in the German army at the outbreak of the Weltkreig, before he is thrust into the trenches fighting the degenerate French barbarians in Northern France. The highlight of the film is undoubtably the First Battle of Ypres, where Hitler bravely defends his trench against the hordes of French charging it as the score swells to the crescendo of gunfire and artillery. The power of the whole scene, especially when Hitler braves machine gun firing to rescue a fellow wounded private, was so immense that it reportedly drove many to tears, including Ernst Rohm and Geli Raubal. Everything from the acting, to the score, and to the technical achievements is already starting to be overwhelmingly praised domestically and even some places internationally where the film is being screened."
