####Event Loc####

rotermorgenGCW.7.t:0 "A Sinking Ship"
rotermorgenGCW.7.d:0 "If one were to look at the streets of Germany’s mighty cities today, you will not see the sprawling streets of Germany’s fortune and victory. What you will see is unemployed men, families on the street with tears in the eyes of children as they go another day without warmth or food. If you look at the idyllic countryside of Germany, you will not be greeted with its mighty farms and the proud agrarian generations who worked them. Instead, you will see foreclosed farms with families with just their essentials on their backs using horses or public transport to go to the urban centers for work, many weeping as the farms their ancestors worked to maintain were gone in days. Yet, the German Empire does nothing to alleviate their suffering. Too concerned with its own imperial confusion to help the average German. Black Friday for many Germans has finally pulled their heads out of the clouds, as they finally see that the Empire cares little for them or their families. Such resentment has done the unthinkable, as people who once detested the reds now are joining one of their many groups. If the Empire does not respond soon, there is no telling how far this resentment will spread."
rotermorgenGCW.7.a:0 "As Dawn Breaks, the Red Morning Starts to Approach."


rotermorgenGCW.8.t:0 "Die Einheitsfront"
rotermorgenGCW.8.d:0 "As the German Empire falters in its ability to deal with Black Friday, the various red groups in Germany have without a doubt capitalized on this. Bolstered by long awaited secretive Internationale support, the three main socialist groups within Germany have drawn tens of thousands into their ranks by the day. While these groups have drastically different ideals, their newfound support has drawn them closer together in unison against the main threat which is the corrupt and tyrannical Kaiser and his cronies. Which is why the radical wing of the SPD, the R.A.M., FAUD, NM-KV and SNF have agreed to join within a United Front to better coordinate their efforts. This astonishing turn of events shows the threat in which the socialists pose to the German order. Whispers in even the highest halls of power are speaking of the possibility of open red revolt should the United Front continue to gain traction. If the Empire is able to start in getting its face out of the mud which is Black Friday, it will face significant challenge from this new United Front in doing so."
rotermorgenGCW.8.a:0 "The Rays of Socialism’s Light Shine into More Homes as the Red Morning Approaches."


rotermorgenGCW.9.t:0 "The Center Cannot Hold"
rotermorgenGCW.9.d:0 "Increased reluctance of the Kaiser’s government has only served to make things worse within Germany. As the ranks of the United Front continue to swell by the day, they are starting to get more confrontational as well. Strikes and protests are common occurrences in the Rhineland, where workers and hastily formed unions have ground any production to a halt. Former soldiers and farmers in Bavaria vandalize government property and homes of the nobility to vent their anger forwards the government’s negligence. In Berlin, daily protests risk turning into riots as the police struggle to contain the citizenry. The troubles don’t end here, however. Reports of new paramilitaries throughout the country imply that the reds are preparing for something bigger. Rumors are even starting to circulate around the high command about potential disloyal elements with sympathy towards the socialists should they decide to take action against the Kaiser. A revolution in Germany, once an idea few thoughts was fathomable, has now become a serious concern."
rotermorgenGCW.9.a:0 "The Red Morning Has Almost Reached Germany’s Doorstep."
