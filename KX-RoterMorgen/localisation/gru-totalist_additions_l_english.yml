####Event Loc####

rotermorgenGCW.7.t:0 "A Sinking Ship"
rotermorgenGCW.7.d:0 "If one were to look at the streets of Germany’s mighty cities today, you will not see the sprawling streets of Germany’s fortune and victory. What you will see is unemployed men, families on the street with tears in the eyes of children as they go another day without warmth or food. If you look at the idyllic countryside of Germany, you will not be greeted with its mighty farms and the proud agrarian generations who worked them. Instead, you will see foreclosed farms with families with just their essentials on their backs using horses or public transport to go to the urban centers for work, many weeping as the farms their ancestors worked to maintain were gone in days. Yet, the German Empire does nothing to alleviate their suffering. Too concerned with its own imperial confusion to help the average German. Black Friday for many Germans has finally pulled their heads out of the clouds, as they finally see that the Empire cares little for them or their families. Such resentment has done the unthinkable, as people who once detested the reds now are joining one of their many groups. If the Empire does not respond soon, there is no telling how far this resentment will spread."
rotermorgenGCW.7.a:0 "As Dawn Breaks, the Red Morning Starts to Approach."


rotermorgenGCW.8.t:0 "Die Einheitsfront"
rotermorgenGCW.8.d:0 "As the German Empire falters in its ability to deal with Black Friday, the various red groups in Germany have without a doubt capitalized on this. Bolstered by long awaited secretive Internationale support, the three main socialist groups within Germany have drawn tens of thousands into their ranks by the day. While these groups have drastically different ideals, their newfound support has drawn them closer together in unison against the main threat which is the corrupt and tyrannical Kaiser and his cronies. Which is why the radical wing of the SPD, the R.A.M., FAUD, NM-KV and SNF have agreed to join within a United Front to better coordinate their efforts. This astonishing turn of events shows the threat in which the socialists pose to the German order. Whispers in even the highest halls of power are speaking of the possibility of open red revolt should the United Front continue to gain traction. If the Empire is able to start in getting its face out of the mud which is Black Friday, it will face significant challenge from this new United Front in doing so."
rotermorgenGCW.8.a:0 "The Rays of Socialism’s Light Shine into More Homes as the Red Morning Approaches."


rotermorgenGCW.9.t:0 "The Center Cannot Hold"
rotermorgenGCW.9.d:0 "Increased reluctance of the Kaiser’s government has only served to make things worse within Germany. As the ranks of the United Front continue to swell by the day, they are starting to get more confrontational as well. Strikes and protests are common occurrences in the Rhineland, where workers and hastily formed unions have ground any production to a halt. Former soldiers and farmers in Bavaria vandalize government property and homes of the nobility to vent their anger forwards the government’s negligence. In Berlin, daily protests risk turning into riots as the police struggle to contain the citizenry. The troubles don’t end here, however. Reports of new paramilitaries throughout the country imply that the reds are preparing for something bigger. Rumors are even starting to circulate around the high command about potential disloyal elements with sympathy towards the socialists should they decide to take action against the Kaiser. A revolution in Germany, once an idea few thoughts was fathomable, has now become a serious concern."
rotermorgenGCW.9.a:0 "The Red Morning Has Almost Reached Germany’s Doorstep."


rotermorgenmisc.8.t:0 "Formation of the German Worker’s Front"
rotermorgenmisc.8.d:0 "Under the recent decree of Volksfuhrer Joseph Goebbels, all national unions are to be consolidated into one national union for the German workers. The newly formed German Worker’s Front, or DAF, is expected to streamline and consolidate all national union bureaucracy into one unit to increase efficiency and save costs that would come with running multiple state unions. There is also a political aspect to it as well, as having one centralized union would ensure that less threats from organized labor would occur against the regime. The DAF is also expected to pursue several economic initiatives to bring greater opportunities for leisure and worker prosperity within Germany."
rotermorgenmisc.8.a:0 "A New Day For Unionism in Germany"

rotermorgenmisc.9.t:0 "Creation of the Volkswagen"
rotermorgenmisc.9.d:0 "Thanks to the recent effort of targeted funding for nationalized automobile plants in Germany, the NMDVP has now perfected an affordable car readily accessible to the German people. Dubbed the People’s Car, or the Volkswagen, is significantly cheaper compared to the consumer vehicles on the market during the reign of the Kaiser while sacrificing little in terms of quality and efficiency. By allowing an affordable car to be given to the people of Germany, it is expected to reduce travel times to and from work while reducing the strain on public transport. Aside from the obvious efficiency increase, the car will now give German families more incentives to travel across Germany whether it be for leisure or vacation. As state automobile plants begin the first vehicles rolling off the assembly line, the Volkswagen is expected to be readily available in most major urban centers by the end of the year."
rotermorgenmisc.9.a:0 "A True Marvel of German Engineering in the Hands of the People!"

rotermorgenmisc.10.t:0 "Der Volksempfänger"
rotermorgenmisc.10.d:0 "Across Germany, many households are being given free radios or ones at significantly marked down state prices. This new mass produced radio, named the Volksempfänger, is expected to bring the entertainment and essentials of the radio into the homes of every German. From UFA radio shows to the latest music, and even from the latest state news to speeches from the Volksfuhrer himself, the new radio is expected to boost the morale of the average German household across the country. It also serves as a means of indoctrination, as the radios only broadcast state mandated programing, which may or may not be so subtle in spreading the NMDVP’s ideas into the subconscious of the German within his own home."
rotermorgenmisc.10.a:0 "Living Room Sized Fun for the Whole German Family!"

rotermorgenmisc.11.t:0 "Development of the Volksfernseher"
rotermorgenmisc.11.d:0 "In a handful of German electronics plants and laboratories, the NMDVP is giving special attention and funding to the creation of a radically new invention for home entertainment. Named by the party leadership and the R&D labs as the Volksfernseher, this new device uses a cable transmission and radio signals to project images on a screen along with audio. While the current product is still early stage and expensive to produce, it hasn’t stopped the upper echelons of the party leadership from installing this “visual radio” into their own homes. Currently, there are only two channels on the Volksfernseher, one for news and one for entertainment which mostly consists of live music performances in various UFA studios. Not to mention getting a decent signal for the Volksfernseher is difficult as there isn’t sufficient civilian telecommunications infrastructure to support it. Despite the early shortcomings of the first few models, the NMDVP is confident that with more funding and attention that even the Volksfernseher might be able to overtake the radio one day."
rotermorgenmisc.11.a:0 "Truly Interesting Times for Technological Advancement."

rotermorgenmisc.12.t:0 "Kraft durch Freuden"
rotermorgenmisc.12.d:0 "As of today, the DAF has announced the creation of a subsidiary agency called Kraft durch Freuden, or Strength Through Joy. Under the direction of the KdF, the DAF will be able to grant generous funding towards programs to expand the options of leisure for the German worker. Already certain towns and villages are being given giant state grants to build and renovate parks and leisure facilities such as sports centers, cinemas, and public restaurants. The KdF is also going as far as offering benefits to working German families to incentivize them to take vacations to state recommended locations, both within Germany and to other nations. While the KdF’s goal is certainly ambitious, the DAF is hopeful that this will end up greatly expanding the options of leisure for the people, which will help to boost, happiness, productivity, and loyalty."
rotermorgenmisc.12.a:0 "I Bet the Brits Don’t Even Get Government Incentivized Holidays to Sweden!"

rotermorgenmisc.13.t:0 "Schönheit der Arbeit"
rotermorgenmisc.13.d:0 "The DAF has announced the creation of a new subsidiary agency named the Schönheit der Arbeit, or the Beauty of Labor. Through the SdA, the DAF is using generous state funding to renovate workplace facilities and promote better hygienic standards across Germany. Mess halls, locker rooms, and bathrooms will all be given renovations to bring them up to a certain hygienic standard, while on the propaganda front the SdA will encourage Germans to do things such as wash their hands and even to quit smoking. The DAF hopes that through the activities of the SdA, workplace happiness and productivity will go up, along with a potentially increased lifespan of the German workers through promoting cleanliness and better workplace standards."
rotermorgenmisc.13.a:0 "Cleanliness is Next to Godliness"

rotermorgenmisc.14.t:0 "Der Volksgenosse"
rotermorgenmisc.14.d:0 "Under the decree of Volksfuhrer Goebbels, a new national printing press will be opened to better inform the German people of the party’s successes. Named Der Volksgenosse, the NMDVP is hoping that this new national newspaper will become the prime source of news and information given to the German people and to act as a counter to the remaining red opposition papers within Germany. Already, the paper is becoming widely distributed across newspaper stands and the doorsteps of German homes. Depending on the success of Der Volksgenosse as being the prime news outlet for the German people, there are potential plans to branch out into radio and cinema news as well once the remaining competitors are either nationalized and incorporated or driven out of the industry all together."
rotermorgenmisc.14.a:0 "Finally, a News Source that we can Trust!"
