GRU_GOEBBELS_DESC:0 "When the 2nd Weltkrieg broke out Josef Goebbels was not conscripted due to his malformed foot, a fact he would later try to supress as good as possible to the public, especially due to his strong francophobia he developed during the occupation.\nBefore the war he worked as a journalist and occasional Film Theatre and Theatre critique in his hometown of Rheydt. He was relatively well known in his home region and within the bigger cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Mönchengladbach near his hometown.\nHis early contact with Marxism during his youth and tendencies to Nationalism influenced his political leanings and ideological thought alot which he had to hide during the reign of the Kaiser or he might have faced a ban on his journalism work due to repressions against far left writers in the German Empire.\nWhile not beeing in line with traditional Syndicalist or Socialist values he can be seen a a mirror to the French Sorelians with his syncretism between ideological concepts that can be found within the far left and the far right he has manifested himself his very own ideology which he calls „National-Marxism“. It still remains questionable if it is actually different to Sorelian National-Syndicalism."
